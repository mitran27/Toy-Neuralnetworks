# Toy-Neuralnetworks
build basic architecture of neural networks from scratch


<h2> Perceptron </h2>
<ol>
<li>Implemented basic unit of Deep Learning Algorithms using Javascript </li>
<li>Implemented a basic pipeline for Deep learning architectures </li>
</ol>

<h2> Ann </h2>
<ol>
Implemented the Feedforwardnetwork/Dense/Linear Layer along with required activation function for nonlinearity
and compiled the linear layer and activation functions with required function using the SEQUENTIAL Model 
The sequential Model is architect to handle  
  <ol>

<li>adding layers</li>
<li>forward propagation</li>
<li>calculating gradients </li>
<li>backward propagation</li>
<li>inference</li>
  </ol>
  
  Built using c++ and python


</ol>

<h2> Cnn </h2>

Implemented and added a CNN layer with forward and backward bass using sliding window technique and Added with ANN module


<h2> RNN </h2>

Implemented a reccurent neural network module which handles sequence of data using a recurrent Ann network with some activation functions ( context analysis ) for sentiment analysis

<h2> LSTM </h2>

Implemented a LSTM module similar to RNN architecture with high level architecture ,logical fates and activation function (very high context analysis ) like forget,reset,update gates for text Generation
