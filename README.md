# Toy-Neuralnetworks
build basic architecture of neural networks from scratch


<h2> Perceptron </h2>
<ol>
<li>Implemented basic unit of Deep Learning Algorithms using Javascript </li>
<li>Implemented a basic pipeline for Deep learning architectures </li>
</ol>

<h2> Ann </h2>
<ol>
Implemented the Feedforwardnetwork/Dense/Linear Layer along with required activation function for nonlinearity
and compiled the linear layer and activation functions with required function using the SEQUENTIAL Model 
The sequential Model is architect to handle 

<li>adding layers</li>
<li>forward propagation</li>
<li>calculating gradients </li>
<li>backward propagation</li>
<li>inference</li>


</ol>
